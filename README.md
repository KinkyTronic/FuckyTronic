# Fuckytronic an OpenSource FuckingMachine

This is a public beta, of a still work in progress design!
If you dont want to waste money please wait for final release!


## Why?
Fuckingmachines are Expensive Toys! Some Kinksters just don't have the needed Money to buy a Quality machine on their Budget.
The cheap options available from China are mostly trash, they don't have a huge Penetration range and also low RPM.
Sometimes they also tend to break pretty easy and aren't repairable.

To counter this, i designed my own FuckingMachine that can be mostly 3D Printed to allow Further customization.
Also, I used mostly off market parts, so anyone can get the parts to build their own version!

## But what does it Cost?

The current version v1.2 with simple PWM poti control for speed costs about 65,43€ plus 3D printed parts 
(about 30€ if you can print them by yourself) so the Full DIY Build costs are currently at 94,43€ for the Budget version! 
If you want better bearings and a bit more stability, you can use the Moderate Version for a full DIY price of about 125,09€

| Version  | Price  |
|--|--|
| Budget  | 94,43€ |
| Moderate   | 125,09€ |



## Roadmap

- Create Documentation
- Adding Different Versions per Budget
- Adding Weight option
- Adding microcontroller support (buttplug.io)
