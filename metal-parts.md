# FuckyTronic v1.1 Metal Parts

This is a list of needed Metal parts to build the FuckyTronic v1.1.





## Recommendations

- Dont use cheap screws, locknuts, washers - they probably will break cause of the vibration
- You should use locknuts cause of the vibrations, if you use normal nuts make sure to use threadlocker
- I would recommend Stainless Steel for all Metal parts, so you dont have to worry to much about rust when cleaning
